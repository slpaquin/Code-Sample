mr.dumbledore is a funny name for a dog.
as a volunteer sherrif's deputy i've been doing surveillance for years.
back then, my life was so great that i literally wanted a second one.
everything was absolutely the same, except that i could fly.
congratulations on your one cousin. i have seventy, each one better than the last
